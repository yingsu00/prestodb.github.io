We are excited to announce today, in partnership with [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home), and [Uber](https://www.uber.com), the launch of the Presto Foundation, a non-profit organization under the umbrella of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

Hosting by the Linux Foundation opens up the Presto community to a broader ecosystem of users and contributors. The Presto Foundation's open and neutral governance enables the community to influence Presto's future, which will also make it more attractive to developers. Together, we will raise Presto's performance, scalability, and reliability to new heights that could never have been reached alone.

This is a new chapter for the Presto open source project. We are very excited for what lies ahead!
